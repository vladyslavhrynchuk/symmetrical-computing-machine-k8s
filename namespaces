By default k8s has 4 namespaces:
	- kube-system (system processes)
	- kube-public (publically accessible data)
	- kube-node-lease (heartbeats of nodes)
	- default (default for creating pods)
To create ns: kubectl create ns [name]
	it can also be created in config map

Use cases:
	1. Logically group resources by role (monitoring, db, elk)
	2. Divide ns by teams to avoid conflicts
	3. Share resources of ther same cluster in different env (stage and preprod can use same ELK)
	4. Limit resources for ns
