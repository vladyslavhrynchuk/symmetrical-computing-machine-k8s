YAML files are used to configure pods, services, deployments, statefull sets etc
YAML file has 3 parts: metadata, specification, status
Specification field is different for each kind of file (service, deployment)
Status part is stored in the ETCD.

Abstaraction layers:
Deployment file manages ReplicaSet
ReplicaSet manages pods
Pod manages container

Deployment:
starts with 'apiVersion' field.
'kind' field describes type of the file (Deployment in this case)
has 'metadata' containing lables and name
'spec' field describes it's specifications. it contains:
	- replicas (number of desired pods)
	- selector (should match label of the container in 'template' field)
	- template (describes container):
		- has 'metadata', which contain label
		- has own 'spec' field, which describes pod specifications and contain:
			- 'containers' describe each container and contains:
				- 'name'
				- 'image'
				- 'ports'

Service
starts with 'apiVersion" field.
'kind' field is Service.
has metadata containing name
'spec' fiels contain:
	- 'selector' to match Deployment label
	- 'ports' which contain:
		- 'protocol'
		- 'port' of the service
		- 'targetPort' of the pod

Label and selectors:
'metadata' contains labels.
'spec' contains selectors.
lablel is a key-value pair which used to bound pods with deployment
Selector should match some label
Selector of deployment 'spec' field must match label of container field
Selector of Service must match label of the deployment
