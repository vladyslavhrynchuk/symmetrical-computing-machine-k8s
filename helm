Helm is a package manager for k8s YAML files.
It stores YAML files in repositories and it is easy to just download hepm chart to install app.
You can create your own Helm chart.
Helm can be used as templating engine.
You can create one template for different microservices and separate file with values for each microservice.
Also, using Helm chart, same application can be deployed to multiple envoronments.

Release is an instance of a chart running in a k8s cluster. 
Eeach time it is installed, new release created

Helm chart sctucture:
	mychart/ (name of the chart)
		Chart.yaml (meta informatio about the chart)
		values.yaml (default values for template files)
		charts/ (dependencies)
		templates/ (actual template files
values.yaml file can be overwritten using 'helm install --set another_values.yaml

Helm has version 2 and version 3
Version 2:
Consists of client (CLI) and server (Tiller)
Tiller runs pod on k8s cluster.
Such architecture allows release management:
	- Stores all charts history
	- Thus, changes can be rolled back

Version 3:
Tiller was removed due to security
