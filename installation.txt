To install k8s cluster, node with 2CPU and 2GB of RAM is required.
Swap on the node needs to be turned off.
Cointainer runtime needs to be istalled.
Cgroup driver of the container runtime must match Cgroup driver of k8s.
After instalin kubeadm, network add-on must be installed (only on master node).

Installing container runtime
1. Update APT repository and install packages to allow APT to use repository over HTTPS
	sudo apt-get update;
	sudo apt-get install \
    	ca-certificates \
    	curl \
    	gnupg \
    	lsb-release

	curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
3. By following command set up stable repository. There is also nightly and test repository.
	echo \
 	 "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
 	 $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
4. Install Docker:
	sudo apt-get update
 	sudo apt-get install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io

5. Check if it was installed succesfully
